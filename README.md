Description

The project consists of a Java application that implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It uses algorithms and low-level code sequences for processing BMP images in RGB format.
Requirements

The project meets the following requirements:

    The source image is a 24-bit BMP file in RGB format.
    Only low-level algorithms and code sequences are used for processing.
    Fully implements OOP concepts, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
    The code adheres to coding standards and is thoroughly commented.
    Performs file I/O operations.
    Allows input from keyboard and command-line parameters for assigning input and output files, as well as execution settings.
    The application is multi-modal, with at least 3 levels of inheritance.
    Utilizes varargs, constructors, initialization blocks, and static initialization blocks.
    Includes an interface and at least one class that implements it.
    Uses abstract classes with abstract methods and concrete classes that extend them.
    Handles exceptions.
    The project is divided into 2 packages: one for the test application and the other for the remaining classes.
    Implements a Producer-Consumer pattern with communication between threads.
    Implements communication via Pipes.

Installation Instructions

    Clone this repository to your computer.
    Open the project in a compatible Java development environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
    Ensure that you have configured the JDK correctly and that the project does not have any compilation errors.

Usage

    Compile and run the application.
    Follow the instructions displayed in the console to input the name and desired effect for the image you want to process.
    After the process is complete, the processed image will be automatically saved to a file with the specified name.
